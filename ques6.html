    <div>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
       event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.Support from our corporate members makes it possible for the jQuery Foundation to continue our work on our JavaScript libraries and pushing the open web forward with events and participation in the standards process.
